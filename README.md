# Salesforce Custom LWC Component Library

Welcome to the **Salesforce Custom LWC Component Library**! This repository is dedicated to building reusable Lightning Web Components (LWC) for Salesforce applications. We aim to create components that enhance functionality and improve the user experience in Salesforce.

## Current Features

### Multiselect Picklist
- Currently, the only component available in this library is a **Multiselect Picklist**. This component allows users to select multiple options from a list, providing a user-friendly interface for input.

## Future Plans

We are continuously looking to expand this library with more reusable components. Future developments may include:

- **Client-Side Routing**: Implementing routing features to enhance navigation within Salesforce experience sites.
- **Additional Reusable Components**: We envision creating various components that can be reused across different applications, such as:
  - Data tables
